For Pipeline Designers
**********************

The pipeline idea
=================

A **LOST-Pipeline** consists of different elements that will be
processed in a defined order by the *LOST-Engine* to transform data into 
knowledge.

A *LOST-Pipeline* is defined by a **PipelineTemplate** and modeled as directed graph.
A *Pipeline* is an istance of a *PipelineTemplate*.
A *PipelineTemplate* may define a graph that consits of the following
**PipelineElements**:

* **Script**: A user defined script that transforms input data to output data.
* **Datasource**: Some kind of data that can be used as input
  :class:`api.script.Input` for a user defined Script.
* **AnnotationTask**: Some kind of an image annotation task performed by a
  human annotator.
* **Visualization**: Can display an image or html text in the web gui that was
  generated by a user defined script.
* **DataExport**: Provides a download link to a file that was generated by a
  script.
* **Loop**: A loop element points to another element in the *Pipeline* and creates
  a loop in the graph. A loop element implements the a similar behaviour as a while
  loop in a programming language.
